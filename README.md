# shorturl
PHP shorturl site project.
Main site: https://6.rf.gd/
There is no sql connection in the code or any piece of code that pulls user data. There is no user limit. In fact, if you are going to use this code on your own site, you can prevent the user from creating the same URL again and again with the help of sql or cookies, or you can set a daily limit.
